Members Directory
=========

A basic application for managing members, re-built in a few of the more popular front-end frameworks/ libraries.
The goal is for this to be as modular and agnostic as possible so that it can be included as a feature into other applications.

## Getting started

Each re-write of the members-directory in different frameworks are independent of the others so to use a particular version clone this repo and extract the one you need.
The app will need to have a database in order to store new users _but it doesn't care which backend you use._
